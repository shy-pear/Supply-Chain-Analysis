# Supply Chain Analysis
## Project Summary
Supply chain data from cosmetics company is broken down into three categories so far:
- Product Profits and Demand
- Inventory Metrics
- Procurement and Production Metrics
For each category, several key metrics are visualized and analyzed. Regression models are used to predict values important for businesses to predict in order to optimize production and maximize profits, such as demand, defect rates, and stock levels. The gradient boost neural network LGBoost is also tested for demand forecasting. A data correlation map to detect multicollinearity of variables and assist feature selection for machine learning.

## Motivation and Goal
Often, companies receive a large quantity of raw data from various parts of the supply chain. Data can come from suppliers, manufacturing, production, packaging, delivery, and customer reactions. It can be difficult to consolidate the data and produce meaningful visuals and track meaningful metrics in order to produce strong recommendations. This is exactly what I aimed to do. My goal is to apply data visualization and ML to help companies understand and discover areas of improvement in their supply chain.

## Tools and Datasets
### Tools:
- Numpy
- Pandas
- Plotly
- Scikit-learn
- LightGBM
- Statsmodels
### Dataset:

## Limitations and Next Steps
There are several ways to expand this project, mainly by continuing the analysis in areas of transportation and routing. Furthermore, this dataset has limited data. Companies are likely to keep track of more details, which can be very useful to produce more detailed and viable predictions and recommendations.

Another way to expand the project is by displaying visuals using a data visualization platform such as Power BI which can help me produce more detailed visuals.
